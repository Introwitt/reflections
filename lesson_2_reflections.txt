What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   When we initalize a repository in a dirctory, we
   can use all the git commands and track all the versions
   of our file in that repository...


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  Staging area is the intermediate step between the working
  directory and the repository which helps you to add the 
  files you want to commit.


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  We would need a remote repository when we want to show our
  work to the public and we would like to welcome the new
  suggestions by the developers so as to make the work even
  mre better
